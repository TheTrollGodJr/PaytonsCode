I fixed your movement system and made it so you should be able to go to each square on the map (if you have the things you need to get there). When you enter a room that has an event in it the event should run. I added variables for each event so all you need to do is add code to add a weapon to the player inventory for example and you need to set the event variable to true so it doesn't run twice.
I left more comments at the top of the code explaining what I did.
Call me if you have any questions.
